   1) Edit python_db_example.py
      DO:  more $HOME/.my.cnf to see your MySQL username and  password
      CHANGE:  MYUSERNAME  and   MYMYSQLPASSWORD  in the main function of
                the program to your username and mysql password 
   2) Edit hw3_soln.sh
      CHANGE:  MYUSERNAME to your MYSQL username 
   3) RUN: ./runpython.sh
      This installs the tables from the HW3 solution and does the inserts.
          - if you like your own hw3 solution, comment out or delete that line
            from runpython.sh
      Then runs the python program.
      The program has functions that are tested to do inserts, deletes, and updates of
      records from the HW3 tables.
